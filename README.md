# esp32_controller
Generic application for an IOT device based on ESP32 controller
## Introduction
The purpose of this application is to provide a small framework to implement different IOT controller devices.<br>
The application run on [Esspressif ESP32 module](https://www.espressif.com) and the development environment is using [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/)<br>
The application provided here is built in Eclipse CDT 2022-09 with ESP-IDF plug-in, based on esp-idf-v4.4.3<br>
The fwk itself is putting together several modules provided in esp-idf (there are plenty of them) and adapted them to my purpose. All these modules are part of the [esp32_common]( https://github.com/ves011/esp32_common) repository.
